A discord bot made using discord.py

## What is this?
There is not really a purpose for this besides it being a code-dump. If anyone wants to use this as a template for their bot, I will be more than happy.
I wrote a lot of this as practice when I was learning discord.py

There are still a lot of useless files like keep_alive.py which is a rememnant of me trying to host the bot so it runs 24/7 and response_lists.py which was used before I knew about APIs and JSONs and all that jazz.
But the point of this is to give a template for building a discord bot so I'm not too worried about it right now. I might fix these issues later.
