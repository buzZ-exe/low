## What is this?
A simple Discord utility bot that handles a variety of tasks, from fun guessing games to sending reminder messages directly to your DMs. The bot can provide useful utilities like creating polls, random facts, or even help manage small server tasks. With a user-friendly interface and versatile commands, it's designed to make your Discord experience more engaging and convenient.

There are still a lot of old files like response_lists.py which was used before I knew about APIs and JSONs and all that jazz.
But the point of this is to give a template for building a discord bot so I'm not too worried about it right now. I might fix these issues later.

It uses the prefix '!' but this can easily be changed.
